# OMR Signature Volatility Models

Welcome to the repository for the 2025-2026 SEM1 OMR project on signature volatility models.

## Overview

This project focuses on using signature based models to analyze and predict the volatility of financial time series data.

## Prerequisites

First, install `uv`, a fast Python package installer and resolver:

1. Installing uv

```bash
pip install uv
```

2. Sync all dependencies (creates venv and installs everything):
   ```bash
   uv sync --all-groups
   ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```bash
   # On Windows:
   .venv\Scripts\activate
   # On macOS/Linux:
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```
